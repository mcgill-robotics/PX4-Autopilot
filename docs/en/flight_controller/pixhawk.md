## PWM Outputs

This flight controller supports up to 6 FMU PWM outputs (AUX) and 8 IO PWM outputs (MAIN).

All FMU outputs support [DShot](../peripherals/dshot.md) ([Bidirectional DShot](../peripherals/dshot.md#bidirectional-dshot-telemetry) not supported).

The 6 outputs are in 2 groups:

- Outputs 1-4 in group1 (Timer1)
- Outputs 5-6 in group2 (Timer4)

All outputs within the same group must use the same output protocol and rate.
