## Purchase Channels {#store}

Order from [S-Vehicle](https://svehicle.cn/).

## Radio Control

A Radio Control (RC) system is required if you want to manually control your vehicle (PX4 does not require a radio system for autonomous flight modes).

You will need to select a compatible transmitter/receiver and then bind them so that they communicate (read the instructions that come with your specific transmitter/receiver).

Spektrum/DSM receivers connect to the DSM/SBUS RC input.
PPM or SBUS receivers connect to the RC IN input port.
CRSF receiver must be wired to a spare port (UART) on the Flight Controller. Then you can bind the transmitter and receiver together.

## Serial Port Mapping

| UART   | Device     | Port          |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| USART1 | /dev/ttyS0 | GPS           |
| USART2 | /dev/ttyS1 | TELEM3        |
| USART3 | /dev/ttyS2 | Debug Console |
| UART4  | /dev/ttyS3 | UART4         |
| UART5  | /dev/ttyS4 | TELEM2        |
| USART6 | /dev/ttyS5 | PX4IO/RC      |
| UART7  | /dev/ttyS6 | TELEM1        |
| UART8  | /dev/ttyS7 | GPS2          |

## PWM Outputs

This flight controller supports up to 9 FMU PWM outputs (AUX) and 8 IO PWM outputs (MAIN).

FMU Outputs:

- Outputs 1-6 support [DShot](../peripherals/dshot.md).
- Outputs 7-8 do not support DShot.
- Outputs 1-6 support [Bidirectional DShot](../peripherals/dshot.md#bidirectional-dshot-telemetry).

The 9 outputs are in 3 groups:

- Outputs 1-4 in group1 (Timer5)
- Outputs 5-6 in group2 (Timer4)
- Outputs 7-8 in group3 (Timer12)

All outputs within the same group must use the same output protocol and rate.

## Battery Monitoring

The board has connectors for 3 power monitors.

- POWER1 -- ADC
- POWER2 -- DroneCAN
- POWER3 -- I2C

The board is configure by default for a analog power monitor, and also has DroneCAN power monitor and I2C defaults configured which is enabled.

The default PDB included with the E2+ is analog and must be connected to `POWER1`.

## Building Firmware

To [build PX4](../dev_setup/building_px4.md) for this target, execute:

```sh
make svehicle_e2_default
```

## Debug Port

The [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) and [SWD Interface](../debug/swd_debug.md) operate on the **FMU Debug** port.

| Pin     | Signal         | Volt  |
| ------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1 (red) | 5V+            | +5V   |
| 2 (blk) | DEBUG TX (OUT) | +3.3V |
| 3 (blk) | DEBUG RX (IN)  | +3.3V |
| 4 (blk) | FMU_SWDIO      | +3.3V |
| 5 (blk) | FMU_SWCLK      | +3.3V |
| 6 (blk) | GND            | GND   |

For information about using this port see:

- [SWD Debug Port](../debug/swd_debug.md)
- [PX4 System Console](../debug/system_console.md) (Note, the FMU console maps to USART3).
- All ports use GH1.25 ,power ports use ports on E2 uses the 6 circuit [2.00mm Pitch CLIK-Mate Wire-to-Board PCB Receptacle](https://www.molex.com/en-us/products/part-detail/5024430670).
